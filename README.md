## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, tailwind

There is a fixed quota of items, with fixed costs set in a useEffect-hook. These items are rendered in a card component. To store the items in the shopping cart the reduce method is used.

## Lessons Learned:

The goal was to create a simple shopping cart app. As an additional opportunity to learn, I wanted to implement Tailwind into the project to design the user interface.
